# Mini-Projects-with-GUI-using-PyQt5
So this repo contains all the small projects that i made with GUI 
here lies the mini projects that are not good enough to have there own repo but good enough that i want to share with my friends.
i know they are only two projects for now that too are way too similar too each other but i do have a lot of source code(games, applications, etc) i will add GUI to them and add them in this repo
