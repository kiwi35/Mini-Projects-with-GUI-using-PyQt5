# Mini-Projects-with-GUI-using-PyQt5
This repository contains small Python projects I’ve made with GUI using PyQt5. These are mini projects that are not big enough to have their own repositories but are still worth sharing with friends.

Currently, there are two projects (which are quite similar), and I have a lot of other terminal-based source code that I plan to add GUI to and include here in the future.

Contents (with GUI):

1) Stop Watch
2) Digital Clock
